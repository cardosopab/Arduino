# Traffic Light Project
This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Arduino [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPqiIzK97K0&list=TLPQMjIwNzIwMjRNuTvugJUuHg&index=13) and is the third project. It uses the Elegoo Super Starter Kit to create a simple traffic light system.

# Project Overview
The Traffic Light Project simulates a basic traffic light using an Arduino board and LEDs. This project is perfect for beginners and helps in understanding how to control multiple LEDs with Arduino and implement timing using the delay() function.

## Components Used
- 1 x Uno R3 Controller board
- 1 x Breadboard
- 3 x LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- 3 x 330立 Resistors
- Jumper Wires

## Circuit Diagram
The circuit is constructed on a breadboard with the following connections:

Connect the red LED to pin 9 through a 330立 resistor.
Connect the yellow LED to pin 6 through a 330立 resistor.
Connect the green LED to pin 3 through a 330立 resistor.
Connect the cathode (short leg) of each LED to the ground rail of the breadboard.
Connect the ground rail to the GND pin on the Arduino.

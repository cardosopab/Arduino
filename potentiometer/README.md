# Potentiometer Buzzer Project
This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Arduino [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPqiIzK97K0&list=TLPQMjIwNzIwMjRNuTvugJUuHg&index=13) and is the seventh project. It uses the Elegoo Super Starter Kit to creates a system where the buzzer voltage is controlled by the potentiometer.

# Project Overview
The Potentiometer Buzzer Project uses the potentiometer to conrol the sound frequency of a passive buzzer.

## Components Used
- 1 x Uno R3 Controller board
- 1 x Breadboard
- 1 x Passive buzzer
- 1 x Potentiometer
- Jumper Wires

## Circuit Diagram
The circuit is constructed on a breadboard with the following connections:

### Connecting Potentiometer
- Connect one outer leg of the potentiometer to 5v.
- Connect the other outer leg to GND.
- Connect the middle leg to pin A5.

### Connecting Buzzer
- Connect the positive leg of the buzzer to pin 3.
- Connect the negative leg to GND.
